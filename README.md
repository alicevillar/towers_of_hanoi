Recursion
One of the classic programming problems that is often solved by recursion is the towers of Hanoi problem. A good explanation and walkthrough are provided by Cormen & Balkcom (n.d.) - the link is in the reading list. (the code they used for their visual example is provided on their website as well).

* Read the explanation, study the code and then create your own version using Python (if you want to make it more interesting you can use asterisks to represent the disks). 
* Create a version that asks for the number of disks and then executes the moves, and then finally displays the number of moves executed.
* What is the (theoretical) maximum number of disks that your program can move without generating an error?
* What limits the number of iterations? What is the implication for application and system security?
